UserUser? is the all‑in‑one desktop application for discovering, tracking, and securing usernames across every major social, gaming, and community platform. Whether you need one single handle or are running exhaustive bulk sweeps, UserUser brings everything together in a sleek UI



🔍 Manual Username Checks



Single‑site lookups



Pick any site from our built‑in list (Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Reddit, Discord, GitHub, Steam, Second Life, Roblox, IMVU, PlayStation Network, Xbox, VRChat, and more)



Or enter a completely custom URL template (https://example.com/{username}) for niche platforms



Paste a comma‑separated list of handles (Bobby44,Relly,…) to check in one go



Instant results marked “AVAILABLE” or “TAKEN” as each profile is probed



Automatic caching to avoid repeat checks and speed up future lookups



⚙️ Bulk Username Sweeps





Flexible length options: choose from 3–8 characters



Pattern modes: letters only, numbers only, alphanumeric, random letters, or random alphanumeric



Random sample count for “random” modes—generate 100, 1 000, or 10,000 candidates at once



Threaded checking for maximum speed (you decide how many concurrent threads to run)



Pause & resume at any point to tweak parameters without losing progress



🌐 Cross‑Platform Audits





Blank‑field defaults automatically target every supported site’s standard profile URL



Custom domain list: paste your own comma‑separated list of site URLs (e.g. your private communities)



Side‑by‑side results table showing “AVAILABLE” or “TAKEN” for each platform



Real‑time “available” alerts feed into your persistent Available tabPause & resume at any point to tweak parameters without losing progress



🔄 Import & Export





Import a JSON or CSV file of handles—instantly load them into the Manual tab for checking



Export your full cache (or just history) to JSON or CSV for backups or external analysis
